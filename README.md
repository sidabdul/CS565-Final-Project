# CS565-Final-Project

Application Description

A web-based Todo list app to manage daily
tasks.

Chosen because I use It daily in personal life on
the iPhone and utilizes fullstack development.

App will use frontend, backend, and API
together.

Common real-world example.

This is just the start of the project, I will add more as time progresses.
